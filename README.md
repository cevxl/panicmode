# PanicMode
This is a simple and customizable [AutoHotkey](https://github.com/AutoHotkey/AutoHotkey) script and executable for a panic button.
The default activator key is the END key.

## Installation
If you simply just want the panic button executable, download the latest version from the releases.

For customizing the script, contributing, or just compiling from the source script, [download AutoHotkey here](https://www.autohotkey.com/) (select the v2.0 version).
Once you have installed it, you can now run .ahk files by opening them with the AutoHotkey launcher or you can edit them by right clicking and selecting "Edit script".

## Features
Current features include:

 - Minimizing all windows on panic mode
 - Stopping media (tested on [VLC media player](https://github.com/videolan/vlc), Spotify, and YouTube)
 - Logging the date and time of a panic activation to a file
